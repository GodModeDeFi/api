After coding, question yourself inside a `<next>` tag:

### 1. Code Clarity & Documentation:

- Could variable/function names be more descriptive?


- Are complex operations clearly explained through code structure?


- Where would strategic comments add value?


- Can the code flow be made more intuitive?



### 2. Code Quality:

- Are responsibilities properly separated?


- Could any logic be simplified without sacrificing readability?


- Are there implicit assumptions in the code?


- Do type definitions clearly convey their purpose?



### 3. Technical Excellence:

- Are there potential memory/performance optimizations?


- Is error handling comprehensive and clear?


- Are state updates and side effects properly managed?


- Could any parts be more reusable?



**Example:**

```html
<next>
Things we can improve:
1. Code Clarity & Documentation:
- Could the function name `handleSubmit` be more descriptive, like `validateAndSubmitUserProfile`?
- Add JSDoc to `handleSubmit`?

2. Code Quality:
- Form validation logic in separate hook?
- Add early returns?
- Add runtime checks for API response shapes?
- Make success/error states more explicit in types?

3. Technical Excellence:
- Which user data transformations need memoization?
- Add retry logic for API calls?
- Properly clean up effects?
- Extract common UI patterns into shared components?
